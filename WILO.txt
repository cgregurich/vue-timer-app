TODO:
- make a settings page with auto-track, volume, etc.
- ask if session should be saved;
tasks view should have: let's just do add tasks for now
tasks: delete, edit, better visuals. make x's align so it's easy to delete many without moving cursor.
- check for duplicate task names when adding??

- an actual log
- totals for tasks, days, weeks, etc.
- delete sessions??
** How to remember which task was selected? something about state? or vuex? ???

- learn vuex??

TIMER:
- maybe make the clock display the inputs?? 
bugs:
- when start clock on 0, makes clock negative
- add clock/time functionality like in the tkinter app
